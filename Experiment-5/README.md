# Frontend Performance Optimization – Learning Outcomes

This module focuses on understanding and applying modern frontend performance optimization techniques using React. By the end of this module, learners will be able to analyze performance issues, implement lazy loading, and measure improvements in real-world Single Page Applications (SPAs).

## 📌 Learning Outcomes

### 1. Understand Frontend Performance Issues

Learners will be able to identify common frontend performance bottlenecks such as:

- Large JavaScript bundle sizes
- Unnecessary component re-renders
- Blocking resources during page load
- Inefficient state and component design
- Slow network and API calls

They will understand how these issues affect:

- Page load time
- Time to Interactive (TTI)
- User experience and responsiveness
- Business metrics like bounce rate and user retention

---

### 2. Explain Code Splitting

Learners will be able to explain **code splitting** as a performance optimization technique that:

- Breaks a large JavaScript bundle into smaller chunks
- Loads code only when required (on-demand)
- Reduces initial load time
- Improves scalability of Single Page Applications

They will understand its role in modern frontend architectures and routing-based loading.

---

### 3. Implement `React.lazy()`

Learners will be able to implement **`React.lazy()`** to:

- Dynamically import React components
- Defer loading of non-critical UI components
- Optimize application performance
- Improve initial render time

They will apply lazy loading effectively in real-world React applications.

---

### 4. Use `Suspense` Fallback UI

Learners will be able to use **`Suspense`** to:

- Display fallback UI such as loaders or placeholders
- Handle asynchronous component loading gracefully
- Prevent blank screens during lazy loading

They will understand how fallback UIs improve perceived performance and user experience.

---

### 5. Measure Performance Improvement

Learners will be able to measure and evaluate frontend performance improvements using:

- Browser Developer Tools
- Lighthouse audits
- Performance profiling tools

They will analyze metrics such as:

- Bundle size
- Page load time
- Render time
- User-perceived responsiveness

This enables validation of optimization techniques like code splitting and lazy loading.
