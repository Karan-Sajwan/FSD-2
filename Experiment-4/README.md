## Experiment Details

This experiment focuses on understanding and implementing different state management approaches in a React application:

- **Local State Management**  
  Implemented component-level state using the `useState` hook to manage UI-specific and temporary data such as form inputs, toggles, and component behavior.

- **Global State Management**  
  Implemented shared state across multiple components using:
  - **Context API** to avoid prop drilling and enable centralized state access.
  - **Redux** to manage complex application state in a predictable and scalable manner.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this experiment, the following learning outcomes were achieved:

- Gained a clear understanding of **local state management in React** using the `useState` hook and learned when to use local state for component-specific data.

- Learned the concepts of **global state management** and identified scenarios where shared state is required across multiple components.

- Understood the fundamentals of **Redux**, including stores, actions, reducers, and the unidirectional data flow model.

- Improved overall understanding of **state flow, data sharing, and component communication** within modern React applications.
