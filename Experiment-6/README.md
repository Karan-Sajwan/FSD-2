# Experiment: Handling Forms and Validations in Frontend

## Aim

To design and implement a frontend form using **Material UI (MUI)** components in React and apply both **built-in (HTML5)** and **custom validations** to ensure correct and secure user input.

---

## Description

This experiment focuses on creating a responsive and user-friendly form using Material UI components such as **Text Fields, Checkboxes, Radio Buttons, and Buttons**.  
The form validates user input using a combination of **HTML5 validations** (like `required`, `type`, and input constraints) and **custom JavaScript validations** implemented through React state management.
